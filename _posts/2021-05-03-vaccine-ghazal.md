<p style="font-style: italic;">I recently hosted an online poetry reading and social gathering called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1T0FBMsOaY">Vax Party USA</a>. The real purpose of the event was just to share some poetry with some of my closest friends, but it was also to celebrate the increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">As the centerpiece of the event, we all worked together on a ghazal about vaccines. If you're not familiar with the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal">ghazal</a>, it's a traditional Arabic poetic form that has spread all over the world. Legend has it that it's the oldest poetic form still in use.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">If you watch the video above, you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1T0FBMsOaY&t=1674s">my sloppy introduction to the ghazal</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1T0FBMsOaY&t=3424s">see my friend Andrew Nicholson read the ghazal that the crowd collaborated on</a>.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">There's something fascinating about introducing people—especially non-poets—to a new form. It's easy to see a lot of variation in how people approached the form, whether they followed all of the rules or not. In my introduction, I joked that since most of us are new to the ghazal, we'd all be "good little formalists" in our first try writing one. Some people definitely took that as a challenge and tried to go as avant-garde as they could. A lot of people kept to the rules too. There were plenty great contributions on both sides. Together, the poem is a kind of wild cacophony of the fears and hopes we're all experiencing right now, as people wish for vaccine adoption to end this awfulness.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1T0FBMsOaY">Watch the full video</a> to get a real taste of what the day was like, with its jarring mix of transcendence and silliness.

<p style="font-style: italic;">Here's the poem.</p>

Moderna travels at -25 Celsius. Don’t open it unless you know vaccines.<br />
Ten doses in each vial come from Massachusetts where they grow vaccines.

Some patients sardined into stadiums to get the serum in their arms<br />
and others hit up CVS in search of unclaimed, ever-so vaccines.

People are afraid to breathe; they can be set free—<br />
embrace the 25 below vaccines.

Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J are going to make a bundle<br />
If we all get in bed we will need a throw made of old yellow vaccines

As if humid air wasn't hard enough to drink, Jair thinks you'll be OK,<br />
In a cauldron fourteen million bodies wide, brews a way to slow vaccines

Measures meant to slow the spread rank below vaccines—<br />
The suspicious still shout and demonstrate, saying no; vax scenes.

To get them into arms faster, maybe we need to throw vaccines.<br />
Or maybe we need a wedding. You’re my new beau, vaccines.

After spending a year-plus on our own COVID Walden Ponds<br />
We shrug off our cloaks of Henry David Thoreau, vaccines!

Following slow torrent of rain over a year,<br />
We rush into our gazebo: vaccines!

Vaccines into arms! Vaccines into shoulders! Vaccines into triceps! Vaccines into muscles! Vaccines<br />
travel under skin, vaccines into chests, vaccines into hearts, vaccines into haircuts, into toes, vaccines!

We’re a Pfizer Pfamily, Others are more Modern,<br />
Different vials, different lots, different needles. Flow, Vaccines!

I almost hugged the Kaiser nurse who shot me up with the beautiful vaccine<br />
Inappropriate excitement among social-distance strangers waiting to go: vaccine!  

We should call it the Johnson vaccine<br />
The Pfizer & Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna & Moderna vaccine

No ending, just a million more beginnings.<br />
Even though at midnight, on my screen glow vaccines.

I got my dosey-dos but have you gotten your single dose of vaccine<br />
Your healthy, lean cuisine vaccine

Grind our scabs, let our wounds heal each other, vaccine!<br />
2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 weeks, embrace, vaccine!

“Which arm?” she asked. I hid my excitement in a nonchalant shrug.<br />
I pretended to be chill, but all I could think was “whoa, vaccines!”

Mundane episodes hindered my attempt to drive toward you,<br />
so I ate some pumpernickel bread to digest the no-no vaccines.

The weight of shame in my arm, as relief washes through me,<br />
knowing I have been unequally visited by vaccines.

It was a date, our times concurrent. The rain began. We hoofed the blocks.<br />
Closed restaurants, their windows papered over months now with Slovak zines.

Zero-sum privileged individualists scramble over the stockpile<br />
while variants evolve in crowded corners of the world that slow vaccines.

Anti-vaxxers are trying to shut sites down—they want no vaccines.<br />
Let's protect ourselves and others around—let's say go vaccines.

So much praise! But is this creation, this marvel, the greatest achievement?<br />
Maybe, rather, that is when a doubter changes and accepts vaccines.

T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, mRNA vaccines, vector vaccines,<br />
swelling, wheezing, sneezing, breezing—by all means, submarines.

The earth is full, the earth lives on, onward through the pandemic—<br />
Birds, beasts, sun, Elliot, rainbow, vaccines.
