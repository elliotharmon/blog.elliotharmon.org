*Hey! ActGreener is looking for a web developer. If that's why you're reading this post, then scroll down to the duck.*

Over the past few months, I've been doing some work with a startup called [ActGreener](http://www.actgreener.net/). ActGreener is a service designed to make it easier for nonprofits to amplify each other. The basic idea: you help bring more traffic to ally organizations, and you get more traffic to your site in return. ActGreener was designed for environmental organizations, but it's pretty easy to see how it could expand to other types of nonprofits and progressive campaigns in general.

I'm excited about ActGreener because it's a chance --- not just for me, but also for the sector --- to try out some new communications strategies.

Big things can happen when organizations move away from thinking of other organizations that work in the same space as competitors. It's a good sign when you see nonprofit communications people thinking less about how to amplify their organizations' brand and more about building a larger and louder platform for the movements those organizations work in. Services like ActGreener are a way to demonstrate --- without a lot of overhead or risk for the organizations themselves --- how all boats can rise with the tide, while also finding ways to optimize that tide by mixing our audiences and communications tactics.

There's another reason I'm excited about ActGreener. Nonprofits need to *own* our messaging.

Right now, if you open your Facebook news feed, you might not see a lot of nonprofits' own posts rising to the top. **Facebook favors publishers that know the tricks of Facebook.** That means that even if you like your favorite nonprofit on Facebook, you might be just as likely to see its message mediated through a separate company, one that may or may not share its end goals. It's time to start bringing that knowledge in-house.

Is this interesting to you? Let's talk. Send me a note at my [very-easy-to-find email address](http://elliotharmon.org/). In particular, we're looking to talk to:

### Nonprofits (and the awesome comms professionals therein)

Am I speaking your language? Do you wake up thinking about how to strengthen not just your organization's outreach, but that of the entire cluster of organizations and activists you work in? You're the person we want to talk to.

In the immediate future, we need some orgs who'd be interested in some very low-impact tests. In the long run, we're looking for a dedicated core of a few organizations to brainstorm, argue, and build with us over the next several months.

### Developers

A cool thing about coming into this project in its very early stages is that technologically, not a lot has been set in stone yet. We're looking to talk to people who have built awesome stuff on the web. Knowledge of environmental issues and/or nonprofits in general is a good thing.

Right now, we're working on getting funding for a web developer. Ideally, we're looking to work with someone in the Bay Area. Let's talk.
